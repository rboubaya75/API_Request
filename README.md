two scripts in Python:
API_Request
How to request an API (SNCF)

"This python class-based program request from a public transport API information about stations, departure, arrival etc of the trains"
I wrote this program to learn how to request and extract informations from a JSON API, which leads me to deeply understand how it functions.
